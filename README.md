# TRIM Helper
This software helps to work with SRIM (Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) software (http://srim.org/). It makes routine operations with TRIM.data and TRIM.IN files easier.
You may configure a new file with custom amount of particles, fixed or random coordinates and angles. Then you may paste it into your SRIM folder and run the calculation.
